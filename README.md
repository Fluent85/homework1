This is my first time making a portfolio web site for my projects.  I'm still having difficulty with some of the css.  It's very diffcult for me to get everything to look like the example.  After I ran my HTML through the validator, it pushed my containers over.  I couldn't figure out how to create a table with images that have text within the images.
